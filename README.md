# Resagratia's weekly challenge

The following questions were answered with PowerBI
* Extract the Ages of each customer from their date of birth
* Categorize the Ages of the customers into the following Age groups 18 - 30, 31 - 40, 41- 50, 51 - 60 and Over 60.
* Visualize the data using a histogram, where each bar contains the frequency of occurrence of each Age group and is also split along gender lines to show the proportion of each gender. Also, make sure the Age group is ordered from the lowest Age group (18 - 30) to the highest (over 60). An image to guide you has been provided below. 
* Finally, find the Age-group that has the highest male-female ratio.
